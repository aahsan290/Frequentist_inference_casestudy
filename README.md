There are two parts to the case study. In part A, we’ll learn the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. In Part B, we’ll apply those implementations to a real-world scenario. 

We be implementing the following concepts as you work through the case study:

The z-statistic
The t-statistic
The Central Limit Theorem
Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample
Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
Hypothesis testing
